# Sample API testing project

:electric_plug: One of my projects to practice API testing was creating a collection of requests to test a sample, locally available API. 

## Summary
* The API connected my client to a simple database containing one table with some mock hotel employee data.
* The API was designed using the **REST** approach and contained five endpoints. 
* I accessed the API documentation via **Swagger** and created a collection of requests using **Postman**.
* For each request, I wrote some basic test scripts.
* The API did not require authentication.

## CRUD operations
:arrows_counterclockwise: The API allowed me to practice the CRUD operations using four HTTP methods:
* Create/**POST**: Add an employee;
* Read/**GET**: Get status; Get an employee by name/by id;
* Update/**PATCH**: Update an employee's data;
* Delete/**DELETE**: Delete an employee.

## Skills practiced
:rocket: Here's what the simple API allowed me to practice:
* **Manually** testing all the endpoints.
* Using **code snippets** available in Postman.
* Writing my own simple **assertions** using JavaScript.
* Using **collection viariables**.
* Using **random/dynamic data**.
* Testing for different **status codes**.
* Validating **JSON** schema and response values.
* **Running** the collection using Postman and via CLI.
